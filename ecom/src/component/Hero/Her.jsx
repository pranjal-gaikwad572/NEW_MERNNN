One is always going to have to buy new things, hence shopping is inevitable in oneâ€™s life. When once shopping meant dressing up and going to malls, today it can be done from the comfort of your house. Online shopping was already booming , but with the coronavirus making stepping out of your house a tricky thing, online shopping took a front seat and became the preferred method for the majority of the market.
